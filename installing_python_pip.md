# Steps followed while installing the python 3.7 and the corresponding pip

## 1. Make sure you have pacman (not the game, package manager).

If you do not have the pacman. Go to the [https://sources.archlinux.org/other/pacman/](https://sources.archlinux.org/other/pacman/) and download and untar the files.  
This leaves you with 3 folders after untar, etc,bin,usr copy these to the root directory. After this you should be able to use pacman. check makepkg if it works.  
  
## 2. Use pacman to download python3.7

Fairly straight way: 
```
sudo pacman -S python3.7
```
This should let you get the python needed.
